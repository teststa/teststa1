Stashcoin Wallet

StashCoin uses the SHA256 algorythm with Kimoto's Gravity Well implementation. 
As it is right now, StashCoin is largely based on stashcoin with some modifications.


StashCoin was created to serve as a vehicle to the many applications the bitcoin technology will allow us to
discover. The bitcoin technology has allowed us to create incredible ideas that will change the way we live. StashCoin aims to, eventually, move beyond that of a currency into uncharted territory. As an open source project, everyone is welcome to become part of the stashcoin community and grow with it. 


The goal for this coin is to learn and grow. 


Tweaks Removed some of the double hashing from the wallet as it is wasteful on compute, No changes to the ecdsa public/private function as that has proven to be secure so far on bitcoin.
